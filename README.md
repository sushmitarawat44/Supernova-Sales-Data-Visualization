💡 Insight: States like California are highly profitable, while others like Texas and Illinois show high sales but negative profit, indicating operational or pricing issues.

📊 Visual: Clustered Bar CHart

💡 Insight: Technology leads in both sales and profit. However, categories like Tables and Binders show high sales with little to no profit — suggesting poor margins.

3. How do sales and profit trends change over time?
📈 Visual: Line Chart (Monthly Trends)

💡 Insight: Clear seasonal spikes in Q4. Some months show increased sales but low profit, highlighting operational inefficiencies during peak seasons.

💡 Insight: Consumer customers show higher profitability compared to Corporate, suggesting better ROI on B2B sales.

5. Are discounts helping or hurting profits?
🔵 Visual: Scatter Plot (Discount vs. Profit, Bubble Size = Sales)

💡 Insight: High discount levels often correlate with reduced or negative profits.

⚠️ Note on Outlier:
A significant outlier with extremely negative profit is present in the scatter plot. This was intentionally not removed to maintain data transparency. It highlights an extreme case of over-discounting and provides valuable context for pricing strategy review.

6. Which shipping mode is most commonly used, and how does it impact delivery time and profit?
🚚 Visual: Bar Chart + Line Chart (Avg. Shipping Delay)

💡 Insight: Standard Class is used most, but Same Day delivery offers faster shipping and surprisingly better profitability.

7. Are there products consistently sold at a loss?
🛒 Visual: Table with Conditional Formatting

💡 Insight: Certain furniture items repeatedly result in losses. These should be flagged for pricing review or potential discontinuation.

8. Who are the most profitable customers?
